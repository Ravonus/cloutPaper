//TODO: I need to make a system that actually generates this file based on plugins that are turned on. (This way typescript can access the files correctly) - Once this is done an API way to grab each of these files as well so you can access them from eachother.

import WallpaperPage from '../pages/main';

const plugins = {
  WallpaperPage,
};

export default plugins;

//export default {};
